East of Mumbai and a lifetime away from the megacity’s hustle and bustle is a natural treasure that was once visible on clear days at Colaba. A thick cocktail of industrial smog now obscures the range of mountains known as the Sahyadris. There was a time when these rugged mountains played a vital role in Maratha history. The forts that still crown some of the most remote hilltops bear testimony to Chatrapati Shivaji and his remarkable understanding of the Sahyadris. In modern times, they have become the refuge of remnant wildlife populations as well as naturalists, rock climbers and trekkers. <BR></BR>

Though the term ‘Sahyadris’ is sometimes used to describe the entire Western Ghats, it is more accurate to associate the Sahyadris with the hills running from the tri-junction of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra northwards to the Tapi River near the Gujarat border. Conservation International has designated this entire chain of mountains, along with Sri Lanka, as one of 34 global biodiversity hotspots. The Sahyadri range is narrow, about 10-20 km. wide from east to west, and about 640 km. long. The western face rises dramatically from the moist Konkan Coast while to the east they fall more gently into the expansive and arid Deccan Plateau. The average height is roughly 1,000 m. with the highest point, Kalsubai, reaching 1,646 m. near Nasik.
